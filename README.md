# Australia Wildfires
***
The Australia wildfires, mainly caused by _drought_ and _extreme heat_, are a countrywide catastrophe, At least **24 people** have died nationwide during this fire season. Nearly **half a billion animals** have been affected by the fires in NSW alone and **millions** of them are potentially dead, according to ecologists at the University of Sydney. Birds, reptiles and mammals, except bats, are among those affected. _Insects and frogs_ aren't included in that number.
> Experts in biodiversity have expressed alarm at the span of scorched earth in a megadiverse country that harbors between 600,000 to 700,000 species, many which are not found anywhere else in the world... Kate Umbers, a biologist at Western Sydney University who studies the Australian alpine grasshopper, is especially worried about the fate of the nationâ€™s 250,000 insect species, of which only about one-third have been named.
