The Australia wildfires, mainly caused by drought and extreme heat, are a countrywide catastrophe, At least 24 people have died nationwide during this fire season. Nearly half a billion animals have been affected by the fires in NSW alone and millions of them are potentially dead, according to ecologists at the University of Sydney. Birds, reptiles and mammals, except bats, are among those affected. Insects and frogs aren't included in that number.
